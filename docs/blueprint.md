## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted blue (#5D9CFA) for a calm and professional look, avoiding distractions.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E0F2FF) to keep with the same style as the primary, but stay clean and light.
- Accent color: Soft violet (#B15DFA) as it complements the primary blue and doesnâ€™t create any jarring contrast. It also adds character to an otherwise simple site.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif. It maintains modern feel without any sharp, fashion oriented-edges. Its humanist touch allows some added warmth that suits the academic nature of the application.
- Use simple, clear icons from a set like Material Design Icons.
- Clean and intuitive layout with clear sections for attendance marking and viewing.
- Subtle transitions for marking attendance and viewing records.
